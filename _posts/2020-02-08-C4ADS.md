In collaboration with the Center for Advanced Defense Studies, I worked with a team to use machine learning/data science 
techniques to identify suspected illegal Russian arms traffickers. We successfully identified a set of ~150 suspicious companies,
which upon further inspection, did appear to be exporting military materials.
