Shogi is a Japanese variant of chess which has been played professionally for centuries. Its most interesting characteristic is the ability to capture an opponent's piece and then use it as one's own by dropping it anywhere on the board.  This vastly increases the game complexity -- it was only in 2017 that computer shogi programs were shown to be decisively stronger than the best humans. (Side note: the US occupation in Japan tried to ban shogi because they saw capturing and using your opponent's pieces as encouraging forced labor!)
<br/>
I did some webscraping and analysis of a database of over 120,000 professional shogi matches dating from 1953 to the present. 

## How does age affect strength?
Player winrates decreased as they got older, showing that even a lifetime of study may be unable to counter younger players with their fresh strategies and brains. <br/>

This pattern is also apparent in the Elo rating (a measure of strength) by age: though there is a wide variability, the average rating clearly
decreases as age increases. The average age at peak strength was 33. <br/>

## First move advantage
White (moving first) was associated with a few percent increased chance of winning, similar to chess. <br/>
